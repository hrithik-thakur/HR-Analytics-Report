The HR Analytics Dashboard seeks to give a full analysis of our organization’s staff losses. It is possible to extract the tendencies and regularities that will enable us to explain the reasons for people quitting our organization by using HR data.
The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of
 employees’s attrition and productivity. It includes KPIs
 such as overall employees, attrition, attrition rate,
 average age, average salary, and years at the
 company. Attrition has been classified into several
 types of patterns such as attrition by qualification, age
 group, or salary slabs as well as experience levels
 while working at the company.
